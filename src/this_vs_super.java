public class this_vs_super {

         this() is used to call the current class members(variables and methods). This is required when we have a
         parameter with same name as an instance variable (field).
         super() is used to access/call the parent class members(variables and methods)

         NOTE: we can use both of them anywhere in class expect static areas(the static block or a static method).

         this() is commonly used with constructors and setters.

         super() is commonly used with method overriding.
